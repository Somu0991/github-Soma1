People starting business considers only those places where population is high or they would start business near city centers. Day by day, as the traffic congestion becoming worse, people from different parts hesitate to travel to places with more venues. So only option for new people is to rent house of high cost in areas with more venues. Business people also does not have any data or report showing them the new areas to explore for starting new business.\n",
